Ensure that your pitch has been approved and moved into pre-production. When features enter this stage, a new working branch in this repo will be created: feature/<feature>

Create a new directory for your spec under the active directory: /active/<feature>

Write your spec following the spec template, leveraging relative links when referencing images or other assets in the directory

When your spec is ready for review, open a new pull request to merge your spec into the master branch

Once all feedback has been addressed and your spec has been merged into master, your feature will move into production.

After your feature ships, move your spec from active to archive
